				<h3>How to Play:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> A new game will generate three random Biomorphs </li>
					<li> Make the Biomorphs evolve by selecting one of the <b>Child Biomorphs</b> </li>
					<li> This will make it the <b>Parent Biomorph</b> and three more Children will be generated based on slight mutations of the Parent's "genome" </li>
					<li>When selecting the Child Biomorphs, try focusing on one feature, like polygon radius or arm length, to illustrate the principal of evolution! </li>
				</ul>

				 	Our Biomorphs game was inspired by the game of the same name that was created for Richard Dawkin's <a href="http://youtu.be/Ok_tcAEbHHw?t=26m17s">'The Blind Watchmaker'</a> as a way to illustrate how slight mutations over many generations result in the evolution of different species. Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker_%28film%29">here</a> for more information on the Blind Watchmaker. Huge thanks and credits to Joseph Fall and Matthew Strimas-Mackey for lots of ideas and help.
